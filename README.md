**Habin Isabelle Kim**

An enthusiastic and artistically trained Full stack Web developer. I recently graduated from Makers - a 16-week coding bootcamp where I embraced XP values, working with Ruby, JavaScript and Java in an agile environment. Before this, I graduated with a First Class honours in Sculpture, where I made interactive and kinetic installations, powered by code and electronics. I am eager for a working opportunity to keep learning and make a change in the creative world of software!

**Skills**

Initiative

I am an independent go-getter. During my degree I outsourced advice to local workshop collectives and digital artists from the UK for help on using robotics in my installations. There was no opportunity in the Fine Arts department to try out electronic mediums, but I used this as a positive to connect with local engineers, artists and geniuses. I taught myself how to use open format programming devices and electrical wiring. With my new found skills I was able to bring my installations alive. It's a beautiful process to write code and see it tested in real life, in the form of gigantic metal sheets!

Creative

I am always open to trying new creative formats, perhaps this is because I am greedy to master as much as I can. As a sculptor I love to build, I always go large with installations (perhaps short person syndrome), creating immersive experiences using electronics, sound and light. I am digitally very capable, I take on graphic design commissions and have an understanding behind aesthetics.

Attention to Detail

I am able to be thorough and accurate when achieving tasks. The nature of building (with many works being huge health and safety risks) means that detail is of the utmost importance. I always endeavour to have a calm and steady attitude towards problem solving and checking work. Perhaps this is where my OCD kicks in!
