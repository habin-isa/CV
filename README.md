**Habin Isabelle Kim**

A creative and enthusiastic back-end web developer working with Ruby and JavaScript. Artistically trained and looking to make a change in the world of digital arts!

I recently graduated with a First Class honours in Sculpture, where I made kinetic installations using electronics - enter coding! I quickly became compelled by the creative possibilities of code, and my problem-solving skills helped this process immensely.

I am currently doing a 16 week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. I am excited to gain a whole new skillset in back-end programming and hopefully to take on a career in the London tech scene!

**Skills**

Initiative

I am an independent go-getter. During my degree I outsourced advice to local workshop collectives and digital artists from the UK for help on digitalising my installations. There was no opportunity in the Fine Arts department to try out electronic mediums, but I used this as a positive to connect with local engineers, artists and geniuses. I taught myself how to use open format programming devices and electrical wiring. With my new found skills I was able to bring my installations alive. It's a beautiful process to write code and see it tested in real life, in the form of gigantic metal sheets!

Creative

I am always open to trying new creative formats, perhaps this is because I am greedy to master as much as I can. As a sculptor I love to build, I always go large with installations (perhaps short person syndrome), creating immersive experiences using electronics, sound and light. I am digitally very capable, I take on graphic design commissions and have an understanding behind aesthetics.

Attention to Detail

I am able to be thorough and accurate when achieving tasks. The nature of building (with many works being huge health and safety risks) means that detail is of the utmost importance. I always endeavour to have a calm and steady attitude towards problem solving and checking work. Perhaps this is where my OCD kicks in!
